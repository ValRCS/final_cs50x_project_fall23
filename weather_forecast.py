# Let's make an application that asks for city name and 
# returns the weather forecast for the next 5 days.

# we will use the requests library to make a request to the weather API
# first we need to install it using pip
# Project page: https://pypi.org/project/requests/
# pip install requests
# once installed (need to install only once) we use it like this
import requests

# then we need an API key from https://openweathermap.org/api
# instead we will use API from https://open-meteo.com/

# we will use the requests library to make a request to the weather API

# let's save a dictionarythat hold cities and their latitudes and longitudes
# we will use this to get the weather forecast for the next 5 days
# first value is latitude and second is longitude

# print the url

# make the request

# print json response
print(response.json())

# let's print time and temperature for the next 5 days
# we will use the json response
# we will use a for loop to iterate over the list of forecasts
# we will iteratete over zip of both lists
# we will use f-strings to format the output
# let's also write to a csv file with two columsn time and temperature
# let's do it by hand first
# we want our file name to have current date and time and city name
# we will use datetime module
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html
